# Wiring — MCU 1 (ESP32-S3 Lolin), explicit pins

Machine-readable version: [`firmware/common/pins.h`](../firmware/common/pins.h)
— keep the two in sync. Diagram: [`wiring-diagram.svg`](wiring-diagram.svg).

> **Board assumption:** full-size Wemos LOLIN S3 (16 MB flash / 8 MB octal
> PSRAM). The GPIO numbers below avoid every ESP32-S3 chip-reserved pin
> (strapping 0/3/45/46, USB 19/20, flash 26–32, octal PSRAM 33–37, console
> 43/44) and the Lolin's onboard RGB LED (38), so they are safe on any S3
> board that exposes them. If your board revision doesn't expose one of these
> pins, remap it in `pins.h` — nothing else needs to change.

| From | To | Wire |
|------|----|------|
| Left wheel | Left N20 output shaft | press-fit |
| Left N20 `+` terminal | L298N `OUT1` | motor wire |
| Left N20 `−` terminal | L298N `OUT2` | motor wire |
| Right N20 `+` terminal | L298N `OUT3` | motor wire |
| Right N20 `−` terminal | L298N `OUT4` | motor wire |
| L298N `ENA` (jumper removed) | Lolin `GPIO5` | PWM — left speed |
| L298N `IN1` | Lolin `GPIO6` | left direction |
| L298N `IN2` | Lolin `GPIO7` | left direction |
| L298N `ENB` (jumper removed) | Lolin `GPIO15` | PWM — right speed |
| L298N `IN3` | Lolin `GPIO16` | right direction |
| L298N `IN4` | Lolin `GPIO47` | right direction |
| L298N `VS` (VMOT, 12V terminal) | 5 V rail `+` | motor power |
| L298N `VSS` (5V terminal, **5V-EN jumper removed**) | 5 V rail `+` | logic power |
| L298N `GND` | common ground | shared with everything |

- Forward = `IN1 high, IN2 low` (left) and `IN3 high, IN4 low` (right), EN = PWM
  duty. If a wheel spins the wrong way on the bench, swap that motor's two wires
  at the OUT terminals (or invert its IN pair in firmware) — N20 `+`/`−` marking
  varies between batches.
- **Motor kill:** `GPIO5` and `GPIO15` low → both motors free-wheel regardless
  of IN pins. This is the safety watchdog's hardware cut.

## I2C address plan

The two AS5600 encoders have a **fixed address (0x36)** — that's why they're
split across the two I2C controllers.

| Bus | Pins | Device | Address |
|-----|------|--------|---------|
| I2C0 | SDA 8 / SCL 9 | MPU-6050 | 0x68 |
| I2C0 | | VL53L0X left | 0x30 (re-addressed at boot via XSHUT 41) |
| I2C0 | | VL53L0X right | 0x29 (default; held in reset via XSHUT 42 while left is re-addressed) |
| I2C0 | | AS5600 left | 0x36 |
| I2C1 | SDA 1 / SCL 2 | AS5600 right | 0x36 (no conflict — separate bus) |

Boot sequence for the ToF pair: hold both XSHUT low → release left (41) →
re-address it to 0x30 → release right (42), which comes up at the default 0x29.

## Display SPI plan

Both GC9A01s share MOSI (11), SCLK (12), DC (14), RST (21); only CS differs
(10 = left eye, 13 = right eye). BLK (backlight) tied to 3V3. When the
lower-face "mouth" display is added later it joins the same bus with a spare
GPIO (39/40/48) as its CS.

## Breakout module pinouts — every physical pin accounted for

I2C is a shared two-wire bus: every device hangs on the same SDA+SCL pair and
is selected by its 7-bit *address* (e.g. MPU-6050 = 0x68), not by dedicated
wires. So most breakout pins beyond power + SDA/SCL are optional features and
stay unconnected (NC).

### GY-521 (MPU-6050) — 8 pins

| Pin | Purpose | Connect to |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| VCC | power | 3V3 |
| GND | ground | GND |
| SCL | I2C clock | GPIO9 |
| SDA | I2C data | GPIO8 |
| XDA | aux-I2C data (for an external magnetometer slaved to the MPU) | NC |
| XCL | aux-I2C clock | NC |
| AD0 | address select: low = 0x68, high = 0x69 | NC (onboard pull-down → 0x68) |
| INT | data-ready interrupt | NC (we poll at 200 Hz; optional → spare GPIO39 later) |

### VL53L0X breakout — 6 pins (×2)

| Pin | Purpose | Connect to |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| VIN | power | 3V3 |
| GND | ground | GND |
| SCL | I2C clock | GPIO9 |
| SDA | I2C data | GPIO8 |
| XSHUT | shutdown/reset — used to re-address at boot | left: GPIO41, right: GPIO42 |
| GPIO1 | measurement-ready interrupt | NC (polled) |

### AS5600 breakout — typically 5–7 pins (×2)

| Pin | Purpose | Connect to |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| VCC | power | 3V3 |
| GND | ground | GND |
| SCL | I2C clock | left: GPIO9 · right: GPIO2 |
| SDA | I2C data | left: GPIO8 · right: GPIO1 |
| DIR | rotation direction sense | **tie to GND** (do not float — defines CW = increasing angle) |
| OUT | analog/PWM angle output | NC (we read over I2C) |
| GPO | programmable output (if present) | NC |

### GC9A01 round display — 7–8 pins (×2)

| Pin | Purpose | Connect to |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| VCC | power | 3V3 |
| GND | ground | GND |
| SCL/CLK | SPI clock | GPIO12 (shared) |
| SDA/DIN | SPI data | GPIO11 (shared) |
| DC | data/command | GPIO14 (shared) |
| CS | chip select | left: GPIO10 · right: GPIO13 |
| RST | reset | GPIO21 (shared) |
| BLK | backlight enable | 3V3 (always on; a spare GPIO later for dimming) |

## Bench bring-up order

1. **Grounds first** — verify continuity between power bank GND, Lolin GND,
   L298N GND before applying power.
2. Power the Lolin alone → flash a blink/hello sketch.
3. I2C0 scan → expect 0x68 (MPU); add ToF + encoder, re-scan.
4. Displays → init both GC9A01s, draw the BOOT gesture.
5. L298N with **wheels off the ground** → verify each wheel's direction
   matches `D:F` forward; fix any reversed motor at the OUT terminals.
6. UART loopback with the CAM board (M6 integration test).
7. Only then: balance tuning with the full stack.
