# Wiring — MCU 1 (ESP32-S3 Lolin), explicit pins

Machine-readable version: [`firmware/common/pins.h`](../firmware/common/pins.h)
— keep the two in sync. Diagram: [`wiring-diagram.svg`](wiring-diagram.svg).

> **⚠ Board identification (2026-07-12):** the first flash's boot log showed
> **4 MB flash, no OPI PSRAM** — the actual board is a **LOLIN S3 Mini**, not
> the full-size LOLIN S3. Everything the balance firmware uses (GPIO 1–18, 21)
> is fine, but the S3 Mini does **not** expose GPIO 39–42 (display SCLK,
> right-eye CS, both ToF XSHUT) and its onboard RGB LED sits on GPIO47 (a
> "spare" below). Those five assignments must be remapped onto Mini-exposed
> pins (e.g. 33–38, 43/44 if console is freed) before the display/ToF wiring
> happens — pending confirmation of the exact board.
>
> **Original board assumption:** full-size Wemos LOLIN S3 (16 MB flash / 8 MB
> octal PSRAM). The GPIO numbers below avoid every ESP32-S3 chip-reserved pin
> (strapping 0/3/45/46, USB 19/20, flash 26–32, octal PSRAM 33–37, console
> 43/44) and the Lolin's onboard RGB LED (38), so they are safe on any S3
> board that exposes them. If your board revision doesn't expose one of these
> pins, remap it in `pins.h` — nothing else needs to change.

| L298N `VS` (VMOT, 12V terminal) | **2S pack `+` (7.4 V)** | motor power |
| L298N `VSS` (5V terminal, **5V-EN jumper removed**) | 5 V rail `+` | logic power |
| L298N `GND` | common ground (2S `−` + power bank GND + Lolin GND) | shared with everything |

- **⚠ Motor rail is 7.4 V (2S Li-ion), not the 5 V rail** — changed 2026-07-12
  after bench testing proved the 5 V rail left the motors with <50% of rated
  torque (L298N drops ~2.4 V; at VS=5 V the motors saw ~2.6 V). With a 2S pack
  the motors see ~5 V — full rating. **Never bridge VS to the 5 V terminal in
  this configuration**, and never connect 2S+ to any Lolin pin (the Lolin's
  5 V input tolerates ~6 V max).
- 2S pack handling: use a protected pack (BMS) or an inline 2–3 A fuse; stop
  using below ~6.8 V; disconnect when idle; power-up order = power bank
  (Lolin) first, then the 2S.
- Forward = `IN1 high, IN2 low` (left) and `IN3 high, IN4 low` (right), EN = PWM
  duty. If a wheel spins the wrong way on the bench, swap that motor's two wires
  at the OUT terminals (or invert its IN pair in firmware) — N20 `+`/`−` marking
  varies between batches.
- **Motor kill:** `GPIO5` and `GPIO4` low → both motors free-wheel regardless
  of IN pins. This is the safety watchdog's hardware cut.

 ⚠ 2S+ must never touch the 5 V rail or any Lolin pin. Battery sense divider
   (GPIO15) deferred — needs re-ratioing for 8.4 V and an ADC1 pin (see pins.h).

 ⚠ ALL grounds common: power bank GND ↔ Lolin GND ↔ L298N GND ↔ CAM GND
   ↔ every sensor/display GND. Without a shared ground none of the logic
   signals are valid.

## I2C address plan

The two AS5600 encoders have a **fixed address (0x36)** — that's why they're
split across the two I2C controllers.

| Bus | Pins | Device | Address |
|-----|------|--------|---------|
| I2C0 | SDA 11 / SCL 10 | MPU-6050 | 0x68 |
| I2C0 | | VL53L0X left | 0x30 (re-addressed at boot via XSHUT 41) |
| I2C0 | | VL53L0X right | 0x29 (default; held in reset via XSHUT 42 while left is re-addressed) |
| I2C0 | | AS5600 left | 0x36 |
| I2C1 | SDA 1 / SCL 2 | AS5600 right | 0x36 (no conflict — separate bus) |

Boot sequence for the ToF pair: hold both XSHUT low → release left (41) →
re-address it to 0x30 → release right (42), which comes up at the default 0x29.

## Display SPI plan

Both GC9A01s share MOSI (8), SCLK (40), DC (14), RST (21); only CS differs
(9 = left eye, 39 = right eye). BLK (backlight) tied to 3V3. When the
lower-face "mouth" display is added later it joins the same bus with a spare
GPIO (16/47/48) as its CS.

## Breakout module pinouts — every physical pin accounted for

I2C is a shared two-wire bus: every device hangs on the same SDA+SCL pair and
is selected by its 7-bit *address* (e.g. MPU-6050 = 0x68), not by dedicated
wires. So most breakout pins beyond power + SDA/SCL are optional features and
stay unconnected (NC).

### GY-521 (MPU-6050) — 8 pins

| Pin | Purpose | Connect to |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| VCC | power | 3V3 |

| XDA | aux-I2C data (for an external magnetometer slaved to the MPU) | NC |
| XCL | aux-I2C clock | NC |
| AD0 | address select: low = 0x68, high = 0x69 | NC (onboard pull-down → 0x68) |
| INT | data-ready interrupt | NC (we poll at 200 Hz; optional → a spare GPIO later) |

| GPIO1 | measurement-ready interrupt | NC (polled) |

### AS5600 breakout — typically 5–7 pins (×2)

| Pin | Purpose | Connect to |

| SCL | I2C clock | left: GPIO10 · right: GPIO2 |

| GPO | programmable output (if present) | NC |

### GC9A01 round display — 7–8 pins (×2)

| DC | data/command | GPIO14 (shared) |

| RST | reset | GPIO21 (shared) |
| BLK | backlight enable | 3V3 (always on; a spare GPIO later for dimming) |

## Bench bring-up order

1. **Grounds first** — verify continuity between power bank GND, Lolin GND,
   L298N GND before applying power.
2. Power the Lolin alone → flash a blink/hello sketch.
3. I2C0 scan → expect 0x68 (MPU); add ToF + encoder, re-scan.
4. Displays → init both GC9A01s, draw the BOOT gesture.
5. L298N with **wheels off the ground** → verify each wheel's direction
   matches `D:F` forward; fix any reversed motor at the OUT terminals.
6. UART loopback with the CAM board (M6 integration test).
7. Only then: balance tuning with the full stack.
